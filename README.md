## Description

This app is intended for users who want to learn English Language and need extra help to improve their language skills. To begin with, the user needs to register and then log in to the app. Then, the user is required to take a quiz and depending on his score, he will be provided with a recommended course. There are two courses- Basic and Advanced. Clicking on the respective course, the user will get access to links that will provide requisite course content/guidelines to further his learning.

Features:

* Analyze Yourself: This will contain a quiz that the user can take.

  If the user is on the Basic Course and if he does well in this quiz, he can get access to the Advanced Course.
  
  If the user is on the Advanced Course, he can monitor his progress.
  
* Dictionary: This contains all possible words one can think of. The user can search any word and it's meaning will be provided.

* More About English: This contains English Grammar books that the user can refer to improve his grammar skills.
