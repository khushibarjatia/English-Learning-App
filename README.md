## Description

This app is intended for users who want to learn English Language and need extra help to improve their language skills. To begin with, the user needs to register and then log in to the app. Then, the user is required to take a quiz and depending on his score, he will be provided with a recommended course. There are two courses- Basic and Advanced. Clicking on the respective course, the user will get access to links that will provide requisite course content/guidelines to further his learning.

Features:

* Analyze Yourself: This will contain a quiz that users can take.

  If the user is on the Basic Course and does well in this quiz, he gets access to the Advanced Course.
  
  If the user is on the Advanced Course, he can monitor his progress. 
  
* Dictionary: This contains all possible words one can think of. The user can search any word and it's meaning will be provided. This will enable the user to get words that can then be used to frame meaningful sentences, thereby increasing his proficiency in verbal and written vocabulary.

* More About English: This contains links to list of the most widely used English Grammar books for user reference.

* Story Books: This includes links to best selling English Novels across categories like Adventure, Horror, Science Fiction, Biographies, etc. This will help improve users' spoken and written English besides providing interesting topics to read, research, etc.

## Future Scope

There are several features that will be added in the next phase to further enhance the applicability of the app such as:
   
   * 'Word of the Day' and 'Phrase of the Day' can be displayed as a ticker to help users learn a new word and phrase each day in a fun manner. This will also help users to crack competitive exams like TOEFL, SAT, etc.
   
   * Some riddles, crosswords and puzzles can be included in the app.
   
   * Chatbot functionality can be added to provide an interface for users to get prompt responses to queries in real time mode. 
   
   * Translation module can be added to help translate words/sentences from other languages to English. This will help adoption of this app across variety of non-English speaking audience/users. 
   
   * The user's progress can be monitored by subjecting him to take regular tests to gauge his expertise on English during the course of his learning. Reporting module can then be included to display his current and previous tests that will provide a very clear indicator of gaps to overcome in subsequent sessions. Comparative charts (bar/pie) can be displayed to showcase user's performance vis-a-vis benchmark results targeted.
